# Fantasy Prototype Arena
A slap-dash website powered by early 2000's style PHP hackery created in early 2016 to test some ideas for a table top and/or virtual card game

Will be hosted on my personal site. If you want to explore this, send me a personal message.

This is a project I hope to revisit. Currently all of the code was created wholey as a prototype, and the code quality show's this clearly. The most egregious example is a virtual tabletop which polls a php script a few times a second, hoping to get a JSON blob of game events. It is however, still a better tool for prototyping a card game than any pre built solutions, so it has served it's purpose.

In the short-term future I hope to try and replace all console messages, window.alerts and magically required URL arguments with Sweet Alert popups
